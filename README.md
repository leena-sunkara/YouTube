# Roles and Responsibilities :

We are team **Propane** with three members, my teammates are Dipu and Vijay. Dipu worked on the home fragment which is having videos in recycler view and on click of a video, it redirects to the another activity where video can be played. Vijay worked on the shorts activity using view pager, which plays videos on vertical swipe and he also added splash screen for the app. 
I have worked on subscriptions and library, where user can sign in using google account, which is done using firebase. Also, after sign in, user can subscribe to any channel and on refreshing the page, user can see that particular channel's videos.

## Key learnings:

We have learned a real developer experience while collaborating the work on Github using Git. We have got very less conflicts as we have communicated well in advance about the work. We have learned a lot during the construct week.

Thank you,\
Team Propane
